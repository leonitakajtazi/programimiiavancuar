1. What language you chose and why
1. I chose Python because it is easy to understand and ideal for tasks like user input handling, working with dates and times, and writing simple programs.

2. How you used the AI tool (what prompts or methods worked best)?
2. I used AI to generate a function that greets the user and displays the current date and time. I prompted it to ensure proper error handling and user input validation.

3. What suggestions from the AI were helpful
3. AI suggested using try-except blocks to handle invalid user input, making the program more reliable.

4. What suggestions you had to modify or correct
4. I had to modify the AI's initial code by adding input validation to prevent empty names. I also included an extra except block to handle unexpected errors more gracefully.

5. What you learned about AI-assisted coding from this exercise?
5. I learned that AI-assisted coding speeds up development by providing quick solutions, but the code often requires manual refinement. AI is helpful for structuring code and handling errors, but verification is essential to ensure correctness and efficiency.
