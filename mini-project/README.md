1. Which Parts Were AI-Assisted ?
1. The core logic of the script (e.g., reading the CSV, calculating statistics, plotting histograms) is based on standard Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The overall structure, including function definitions and error handling, was AI-assisted.

2. Challenges Encountered and How You Solved Them
2. Handling Missing Data:
The script uses .dropna() to remove missing values from a column before performing calculations or visualizations.

Error Handling:
The script checks if the column exists in the DataFrame before performing actions and provides error messages for invalid inputs or missing arguments.


3. Which Parts You Modified?
3. I might have adjusted or added specific details, such as column names, tweaked the threshold for detecting outliers, or made changes to the plotting options to better fit the dataset.
